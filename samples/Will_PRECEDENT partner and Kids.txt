If I do not leave a list, or if any of my Personal Belongings are not listed, I give my Personal Belongings to my Partner wife/husband Partner first nameabsolutely if he survives me by 30 days.
If the gift made to my Partner wife/husband Partner first namein this clause fails, I give my Personal Belongings to such of my Children who become a Qualifying Beneficiary, and if more than one, as tenants in common in equal shares absolutely.
I give my Executor the power to decide which of my chattels are my Personal Belongings.
I direct that my Personal Effects other than my Personal Belongings are to form part of my Residual Estate.

Outright Beneficiaries
When an outright gift is given to a person on the condition that they are (or must become) a ‘Qualifying Beneficiary’, the condition is only satisfied (and the person is for this purpose a Qualifying Beneficiary) only if the person:
Survives me by 30 clear days or is born after my death;
Is living on the date on which the person or persons entitled to the gift must be determined in accordance with the terms of my Will; and
Reaches the age of 25 years (the Qualifying Age).
If an outright gift is given to more than one Qualifying Beneficiary, then unless otherwise stated for that gift, the gift must be distributed in equal shares (as tenants-in-common) among those Qualifying Beneficiaries.
[bookmark: _Toc340681273][bookmark: _Toc256000024][bookmark: _Toc959643]Vesting of entitlements
Any gift that depends on the beneficiary surviving me by a specified period, or reaching a specified age, is contingent and does not vest in the beneficiary unless and until he or she has survived for the specified period or reached that age.
Income produced by the gift between my death and the vesting of the gift accumulates to the gift.

[bookmark: _Ref264388627]If a beneficiary disclaims all or part of the assets that would otherwise be distributed to them under my Will, the assets to which the disclaimer relates become part of the balance of my estate.
Notwithstanding any other term of my Will, to the extent that a beneficiary, by reason of bankruptcy, an arrangement with his or her creditors, or otherwise, would not personally benefit from a gift made under my Will, the gift made to that beneficiary is not to take effect.
[bookmark: _Toc436036344][bookmark: _Toc959645]Prospective beneficiary

The Prospective Beneficiary; and
A person considered by my Executor to be a dependant of the Prospective Beneficiary
including to:
Pay or contribute towards the food and accommodation needs of the beneficiary;
Pay for all forms of health and medical care, and health insurance of the beneficiary;
Pay for childcare, school and higher education fees of the beneficiary;
Pay for recreational expenses, travel expenses, and other day to day needs and expenses of the beneficiary;
Make payments to the beneficiary by way of pension or allowance;

If an intended beneficiary (the Beneficiary) dies before attaining a vested interest in my estate, but leaves a Child (or Children) who:
Is or becomes a Qualifying Beneficiary; and
Is living on the date of death of the Beneficiary (Reserve Date),
(a Survivor), then the Survivor receives the interest the Beneficiary would have received had the Beneficiary attained a vested interest. If there is more than one Survivor, then each receives an equal share.
If a Survivor who would otherwise have taken the place of the Beneficiary dies before attaining a vested interest in my estate, but leaves a Child (or Children) who is or becomes a Qualifying Beneficiary and is living on the Reserve Date (the Further Survivor), then the Further Survivor receives the interest the Survivor would have received had the Survivor attained a vested interest.

Schedule ADJ: Adjustments
Overriding priorities for my Executor
[bookmark: _Ref264800774]Notwithstanding the other terms of my Will, my Executor must administer my estate in a manner that gives priority to the following:
First, the division of my estate (and other assets) between my Beneficiaries in the same aggregate proportions as outlined in my Will; and
Secondly, having regard to taxation, capital preservation and other matters, the most cost and tax effective and efficient manner of dealing with the assets.
Subject to Paragraph 1(a), in satisfying any gift made under my Will, my Executor may pay a greater part of any particular asset or benefit (or class of asset or benefit) to a particular Beneficiary or Testamentary Trust, to the exclusion of any other Beneficiary or Testamentary Trust.
It is my strong wish that prior to exercising any power under this Schedule, my Executor obtains appropriate legal, taxation, financial and other professional advice, having regard to the character of my assets and the particular circumstances of my Beneficiaries.
Direction to adjust entitlements for Total Wealth
If I have directed my Executor to adjust the quantum of a Beneficiary's share of my residual estate under this Schedule with regard to the Beneficiary's entitlement to participate in my Total Wealth, my Executor must determine that Beneficiary's share of my residual estate on the basis that:
The total value of my residual estate includes the value of each Beneficiary’s interest or participation in my Total Wealth; and
Each Beneficiary's individual share in my residual estate is partly (or wholly) satisfied by their interest or participation in my Total Wealth.
If a person brings a claim for further provision from my estate that is not provided for in my Will (an Inheritance Claim), the terms of this Schedule dealing with my Total Wealth do not apply to the extent they may increase the quantum of assets that would otherwise accrue to the person making the Inheritance Claim.
Meaning of Total Wealth
In my Will my Total Wealth includes all of the following assets and amounts (unless specifically stated otherwise):
Any entitlements to the proceeds of a policy of life insurance paid to or for the benefit of one or more Beneficiaries as a consequence of my death (either directly or indirectly, and whether through or outside my estate);
Any entitlements to superannuation and other death benefits paid to or for the benefit of one or more Beneficiaries as a consequence of my death (either directly or indirectly, and whether through or outside my estate);
My proportionate interest in the value of any real property (the Joint Property) that passes on my death to a person who is a surviving joint tenant in the Joint Property;
The face value of any loans forgiven to a Beneficiary under my Will;
The balance of my estate; and
My interest as beneficiary as member in any Trust, Joint Venture or other enterprise outside my direct personal ownership in which I have a beneficial interest. 
Definitions
Unless the context otherwise requires, the following expressions have the following meanings:
Beneficiary means each beneficiary named in the Main Provisions, and for the purposes of this Schedule includes:
Their respective spouses and Children;
The trustees of the Testamentary Trusts in respect of which they are nominated as a Nominated Beneficiary; and
Entities in which they hold a direct or indirect beneficial interest; and
The trustees of trusts for which the beneficiary (or their respective spouses and Children) directly or indirectly hold the power to remove and appoint the trustee.
Interpretation
The definitions set out in my Will apply to this Schedule.
A reference in this Schedule to a Paragraph is, unless otherwise stated, a reference to a paragraph of this Schedule.
